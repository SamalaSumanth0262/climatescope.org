##What is the Global Climatescope?

The Global Climatescope is a report and index that assesses the investment climate for climate-related investment worldwide.

It profiles 53 countries worldwide and evaluates their ability to attract capital for low-carbon energy sources while building a greener economy. 

The Global Climatescope is a snapshot of where clean energy policy and finance stand today, and a guide to where clean energy can go tomorrow.

This marks the third year of the Climatescope project. In 2012 and 2013, the Climatescope focused exclusively on Latin America and the Caribbean. It originated with the Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-American Development Bank Group who joined forces with Bloomberg New Energy Finance to develop the 2012 edition. 

In 2014, the UK Department for International Development and the US Agency for International Development have joined as supporters and advisors. The project has been expanded to include 53 countries, states, and provinces in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Bloomberg New Energy Finance serves as research partner and author of the report, and remains solely responsible for its editorial content.
