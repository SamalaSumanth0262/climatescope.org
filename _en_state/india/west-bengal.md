West Bengal ranked ninth among the 10 Indian states included in Climatescope 2014. It scored 0.78 and performed best in Parameter III, Low-Carbon Business, as it is home to some of the oldest solar manufacturers in India.

The services sector comprises two-thirds of the state’s $116bn economy. A total of $378m was invested in its clean energy sector from 2006–12, the last year for which data is available.

Small hydro is the main clean energy sector in West Bengal, making up most of its installed renewable energy capacity. The state has several small-scale biomass plants, but very little wind or solar. Despite its solar manufacturing capacity, it lags behind in deploying solar projects.

In 2012, West Bengal generated an estimated 57TWh, although not all of it was consumed within the state. Coal-fired plants supplied 91% of total electricity generation, while renewables contributed a very slight 1.4% (and represented an equally slight 1.4% of installed capacity). The state’s distribution utility, the West Bengal Electricity Distribution Company, is in good financial and operational health and has an ‘A’ rating issued by the Ministry of Power.

West Bengal has been contemplating large-scale groundmounted solar as well as large rooftop solar installations in some of its major cities such as Kolkata. Coastal and low-lying, the state does not have very good wind resources.
