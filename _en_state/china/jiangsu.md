Jiangsu ranked fifth out of 15 Chinese provinces analysed by Climatescope 2014. It scored 1.25, performing best in Greenhouse Gas Management Parameter IV. More specifically, the province’s highest score was for corporate awareness of GHG management, and it has one of the highest emissions reduction targets in China: an 18% reduction on 2010 levels by 2015.

Jiangsu is located on the eastern coast of mainland China. An urban and affluent province, its 2013 GDP was $962bn. Jiangsu received $3.3bn in clean energy investments in 2013, out of a total of $12.1bn from 2006-13. Solar (478MW) represented the largest share (51%) of 2006-13 investments, though wind has a greater installed capacity (2.4GW). Total renewable energy capacity is 3.6GW.

Jiangsu is one of the most proactive of China’s populous coastal provinces in promoting renewable energy, in particular solar as it is home to a number of the world’s largest solar manufacturers.

It is also home to the majority of China’s offshore wind projects.

In 2013, Sinohydro Group installed a 50MW intertidal project, the only offshore wind built that year. However, three further projects exceeding a combined 1GW were approved in 2013.

In 2013, the provincial government announced subsidies on top of national support for distributed solar power. Clean energy development in Jiangsu is likely to continue, particularly distributed PV solar and offshore wind projects.

In 2013, Jiangsu sourced 86% of its electricity needs from coal, out of a total of 415.8TWh. Renewables represented only 1.9% of generation in 2013 (and 4.8% of installed capacity).
