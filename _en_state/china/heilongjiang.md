Heilongjiang ranked 12th among the 15 Chinese provinces reviewed by Climatescope 2014, with a score of 1.06. It performed best on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, reflecting corporate awareness of emission reduction policies, energy efficiency initiatives and clean energy capacity building.

Located in northeast China, the province has relatively large wind and biomass and waste-to-energy industries. More than half of all biomass and waste-to-energy projects in northeast China are located in Heilongjiang. In terms of power generation, Heilongjiang relies on coal, with substantial contributions from wind and large hydropower. Its GDP in 2013 was $237.5bn.

In 2013, Heilongjiang generated 84.1TWh of electricity, 88.1% of which it sourced from coal. Renewables supplied 10.4%, mainly in the form of wind (58.5%). The province has installed renewable energy capacity of 5GW, which represents 21.9% of the total.

In 2013, Heilongjiang received $1bn in clean energy investment, out of a cumulative $10.5bn since 2006. During this period, the wind sector received the biggest share of investment.

No new projects have been approved by the National Energy Administration since 2012 owing to severe grid curtailment in the province. Some improvements were made to the transmission line between Northeast China and North China in 2013; however, significant growth in either wind or solar deployment is unlikely while the problem persists.
