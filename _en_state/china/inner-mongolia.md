The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region ranked fourth among the 15 Chinese provinces surveyed on Climatescope 2014, with a score of 1.32. Its best performance was on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV thanks to its CDM projects and corporate awareness of emission reduction policies, energy efficiency initiatives and clean energy capacity building.

Inner Mongolia is the third largest subdivision in China and in 2013 its GDP was $278bn. Although rich in coal resources, it also uses its vast wind resources to generate power. Any excess is distributed to northern and north-eastern China.

In 2013, Inner Mongolia received $5.2bn in clean energy investments, out of a cumulative $40.3bn since 2006. The wind sector received the largest share, with solar picking up the pace from 2012. The province has 19.2GW of renewable energy capacity, which represents 24% of total installed capacity.

In 2013, Inner Mongolia generated a total of 334.7TWh, of which 90% was sourced from coal and 8.9% from renewables.

Wind accounted for 95.6% of the latter; indeed, the province has more than 20% of Chinaâ€™s total wind capacity.

In 2013, wind power equipment worked an average of 2,076 hours per year, while the curtailment rate of 18% was higher than the national average of 11%. With planned ultra-high voltage transmission projects underway, it will be able to distribute more excess wind from 2015. In addition, over 1GW of gridconnected PV projects were commissioned in 2013.
