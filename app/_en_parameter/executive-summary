Welcome to Climatescope, an assessment of clean energy market conditions and opportunities in 58 emerging nations in South America, Africa, the Mideast, and Asia. This third global release of the project takes into account the extraordinary 12 months of clean energy investment, construction, and policy-making of 2015. It also contextualizes that progress against activity in other, wealthier nations. As in years past, Climatescope scores countries based on their levels of activity and the environments they create to attract further clean energy investment. 

*<strong>The center of the clean energy universe has now shifted decisively from “north” to “south”.</strong>Compared to wealthier Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the Climatescope nations in 2015 cumulatively attracted more investment ($154.1bn vs. $153.7bn) and saw far more clean energy capacity build (69.8GW vs. 59.2GW). China was a large part of this, but lesser developed nations also played a role. Year-on-year, investment growth and deployment growth rates were also far higher in Climatescope nations than in OECD countries.
*<strong>Steep solar equipment cost declines are catalysing build and driving growth.</strong>Investment in utility-scale solar in Climatescope nations spiked 43% from 2014 to $71.8bn in 2015. Total clean energy investment in Climatescope countries rose $24.8bn with solar accounting for nearly all of that. Photovoltaic (PV) costs are essentially on par with wind and, as recent tenders for power contracts have demonstrated, PV can now out-compete fossil-fuelled projects on price.
*<strong>Equipment cost declines, most notably for solar, along with innovative business and financing models are revolutionizing how energy access issues are being addressed in least developed nations.</strong>No less than 1.2bn people continue to lack sufficient access to energy, but conventional hub-and-spoke responses to this problem are being challenged by a slew of new players focused on “off-grid” or “mini-grid” solutions. Many are privately-funded start-ups who between them had raised over $450m cumulatively through 2015.
*<strong>Spurred by the Paris global climate pact, an unprecedented four out of five Climatescope nations now have national clean energy targets while three in four have set CO2 emissions reduction goals.</strong>That’s up from 58% and 22%, respectively in 2014. The UN-organized climate talks galvanized countries to act. However, many now lack specific policy mechanisms to achieve their goals. 
*<strong>Wealthier nations are accelerating their funding for clean energy in emerging markets.</strong>Private investors, lenders, and development finance institutions in OECD countries accounted for nearly half of all capital to Climatescope countries (excluding China, where virtually all capital was provided locally). This is up from the roughly one third of capital provided in 2012.
*<strong>Climatescope countries which have seen the highest rates of clean energy penetration are now beginning to encounter integration challenges.</strong> In some nations, wind or solar projects have been completely built – without any associated transmission to deliver power. In others, grid operators have prioritized delivery of electrons from fossil-fuelled plants over those from renewables projects.
*<strong>These improving conditions are reflected in the higher Climatescope scores achieved by the majority of countries surveyed.</strong>The average score across all countries reviewed in the project rose from 1.14 to 1.35 (on a 0-5 scale) while the number of countries scoring above 2 jumped from two to 10.  China once again topped the list of all countries. Chile, Honduras, Kenya, Mexico and Uruguay are the top scorers that recorded the most improvement.
