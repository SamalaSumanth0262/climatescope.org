The Enabling Framework includes a total of 22 indicators, which assess a countryâ€™s policy and power sector structure, levels of clean energy penetration, level of price attractiveness for clean energy deployment, and the expectations for how large the market for clean energy can become. 

Parameter I takes into account a wide variety of indicators to compile a final score. This ranges from the macro in the form of overall policy scores for a country's clean energy policy regime, to the micro in the form of kerosene or diesel prices for lesser developed nations. 

A diversity of nations that scored well on Parameter I. Top five finishers included not only the world's second and seventh largest economies (China and Brazil, respectively) but also the Dominican Republic, Kenya, and Rwanda. The diversity is boosted by the Climatescope methodology which specifically sought to take into account the somewhat different conditions required to facilitate clean energy growth in the world's least developed countries. 

Those nations that finished near the bottom of the Parameter I table tended to fall into three categories. First, there were those that have bountiful local energy supplies that manifest themselves in low-priced electricity for consumers. Such low prices make it challenging for clean energy developers to compete. Second, there were nations where energy actually is quite pricey but have seen virtually no clean energy uptake to date. Finally, there were nations where particularly low scores on the policy indicator due to a lack of incentives hindered their Parameter I score overall.
