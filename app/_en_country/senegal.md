Senegal achieved a score of 0.89 to rank 37th in Climatescope 2014. The country finished highest on Low-Carbon Business and Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, at 22nd place.

While Senegal attracted no clean energy investment in 2013, it received $210m between 2006 and 2012. The majority (65%) went to the biofuel sector, with the remainder going to biomass.

Overall, around 54% of the population has access to the 840MW of installed power capacity, with a sharp divide between the rural and urban population. Oil and diesel plants make up 675MW of total capacity and come at a high cost as the country relies on fossil fuel imports.

In 2013, Senegal held an initial renewable energy tender for 310MW of capacity to be built by 2017. The country was due to implement a net metering law in 2014, and further tax incentives are expected as it implements the Renewable Energy Orientation Law of 2010. Senegal approaches rural electrification through a system of concessions, six of which have been allocated so far, but progress is relatively slow.
