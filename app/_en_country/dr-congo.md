Score Summary

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) scored 0.55 overall in Climatescope 2015, slipping several places to finish 50th on the list of countries overall and last among the African nations. The countryâ€™s highest score was on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV. 
On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the DRC ranked 50th. Its score was weakened by the lack of clean energy incentives and the lack of openness in the structure of its power sector. 
The country fell 29 places to take 49th position on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, partly reflecting the absence of any new investment. 
On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the DRC finished 47th, down 16 places on 2014, with an absence of value chain players in most clean energy segments. 
On Parameter IV, the country ranked 29th, scoring best in the carbon-offsetting category, in particular for the number of carbon credits generated relative to its overall emissions.
