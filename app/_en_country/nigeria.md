Score Summary

Nigeria scored 1.58 in Climatescope 2015, placing it 12th on the list of countries overall. This was an increase from 2014 and was largely due to a higher score on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II in general, and the growth rate of clean energy investment in particular. 
On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the country’s score increased thanks largely to a rise on its small base of clean energy generating capacity.
On Parameter II, Nigeria ranked 7th overall and highest among the African nations. This reflected an increase of 158% in the volume of asset finance to $359m in 2015. 
Nigeria’s high score on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III was supported by a high number of value chains and service providers. 
On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, the country was ranked 30th and showed some strength in the carbon offsets category.
