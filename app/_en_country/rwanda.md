Score Summary

Rwanda scored 1.41 in Climatescope 2015, placing it 17th on the list of countries overall. The country gained six places on its ranking in 2014 thanks to improved scores on Enabling Framework Parameter I and Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II. 
The country was strongest on Parameter I, where it placed second globally, behind only Uruguay. This reflected growth in its already high proportion of clean energy generating capacity.
On Parameter II, Rwanda’s score rose sharply thanks to an increase in the growth rate of clean energy investment.
On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country’s score was slightly better than average. It was supported by a relatively high number of distributed clean energy value chains and service providers. 
Rwanda was ranked 47th on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV as it has no carbon reduction policies.
