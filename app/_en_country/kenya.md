Kenya secured seventh position globally and second in Africa, with a score of 1.73. Its best performance was on Clean Energy Enabling Framework Parameter I, largely due to its solid policy framework. It also received recognition for its strong clean energy value chains.

The country has the largest economy in East Africa, though its regional peers are catching up. The agricultural sector still accounts for the largest share of GDP but Kenya has seen significant growth in services as well. Clean energy investment last year amounted to $481m, bringing its total for 2006-13 to $4.7bn. Of that, 85% went to geothermal, its flagship renewables sector.

Kenya’s partly liberalized power sector relies almost entirely on large hydro, oil & diesel, and geothermal generation, which together met 91% of local demand in 2013. The country has made significant progress in improving citizens’ electricity access, nearly doubling electrification rates since 2006 to 29% in 2013. The government has pledged to reach universal access by 2030.

All eyes are now on forthcoming energy sector legislation.

A draft released in Q1 2014 contains ambitious 2030 clean energy targets, including a planned 5.3GW of new geothermal and 3GW of new wind, together with 5.4GW of fossil capacity and 4GW of nuclear.
