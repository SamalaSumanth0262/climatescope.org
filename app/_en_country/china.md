Score Summary

China scored 2.29 overall in Climatescope 2015, placing it first on the list of all Climatescope countries. China’s 2015 overall score was a slight improvement on 2014’s 2.23, when it also finished first among all countries surveyed. The country’s top ranking is based largely on its consistency in the top levels of all four Climatescope parameters. It scored no lower than eighth on any of them and was first on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III and Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV. On Enabling Framework Parameter I, China scored 1.54. It registered improvement from 2014 on both the Growth Rate of Installed Capacity and Clean Energy Electricity Generation indicators. That advance was partially offset by a decline on the Growth Rate of Power Demand Indicator. On Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, China scored 1.46. It improved on the Growth Rate of Clean Energy Investments Indicator while retreating somewhat on the Loans, Grants, Grant Programs Indicator. On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, China saw its score remain unchanged at a perfect 5.00 due to its consistent investments in value chain segments present in the country. On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, China scored 3.24, up 0.12 from 2013, as more provinces set up local carbon emission targets than previously.

Score Summary - Provinces

The 15 Chinese provinces evaluated by Climatescope scored significantly higher than in the previous year. In particular, Qinghai, Yunnan and Gansu scored higher than China overall based on their substantial improvements in local transmission infrastructures and policy incentives for clean energy deployment. China’s provincial profiles are diverse and fall into three cohorts: (1) The generation-resource rich west, (2) the east and south demand centers and (3) the demand-restraining provinces. The country’s resource-rich west includes Gansu, Xinjiang, West Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and Yunnan. All performed well on Parameters I and IV, based on their levels of clean energy investment and establishment of GHG emission targets. Newly built long-distance transmission systems, connecting these resource hubs with the manufacturing-heavy eastern and southern demand centers, boosted clean energy integration significantly in 2014.
The eastern and southern manufacturing-heavy provinces are Sichuan, Jiangsu, which surrounds Shanghai, and Hebei surrounding Beijing. Sichuan and Jiangsu performed well on the value chain and GHG emission targets indicators. Hebei, on the other hand, is a source of the air pollution plaguing Beijing and Tianjin, thanks to extensive coal burn. Those municipalities’ strong power demand prevents Hebei from cutting fossil fuel usage to meet its 2015 GHG emission target, despite the local government’s pledge. The third cohort, demand-restraining provinces, includes Guangdong, Shandong, Fujian and Heilongjiang. They scored lower on all four parameters, in part because their power-demand growth slowed in 2014. As a result, new generation capacity additions were small compared to the other provinces evaluated.
