India is the world's second-most populous country and among its fastest growing economies, with a 2013 GDP of $1.9 trillion.

Steadily rising power demand, good-to-excellent renewable resources and often-impaired fossil fuel supply chains make India a growth market for clean energy. The country received $6bn in clean energy investment in 2013, out of a total of $62bn from 2006 to 2013. Wind is the largest renewable energy sector, with 60% of capacity and 53% of all investment from 2006 to 2013.

Coal is still the backbone of the country's power system, providing 71% of its 1,088TWh of total generation in 2013. However, renewable power is an important and growing part of the country's energy matrix: at 33GW it comprised 14% of installed capacity but only 5.5% of generation in 2013.
