Score Summary

Liberia scored 0.91 in Climatescope 2015, placing it 35th on the list of countries overall, the same position it occupied in 2014. Its highest score by far was on Enabling Framework Parameter I. 
Nevertheless, the country dropped four places on Parameter I to rank 12th. It scored highly for the relative price attractiveness of clean energy as well as market size expectations, as well as for policies related to energy access. 
On Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, Liberia was placed 31st. Its score was boosted by the size of investments in previous years relative to its small economy, but weakened by the absence of new investment.
Liberia ranked 40th overall on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, with few value chain companies or service providers present. 
On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, the country ranked a very poor 54th, above only Haiti.
