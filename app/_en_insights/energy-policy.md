As the energy transition gains pace and strength, emerging market nations are leading the way, not just in terms of investment and deployment, but with innovative policy-making as well. Here we assess the clean energy landscape of the 71 countries studied for Climatescope by examining both the unique challenges they face and the novel policies they have crafted to overcome them.
* This year's Climatescope rankings reveal three general country groups: 
  - The Slow-Starters, which have recorded little to no clean energy activity to date. 
  - The Capacity-Builders, which are actively building policy frameworks that are showing results or could soon. 
  - The Ceiling-Hitters, which have taken positive policy steps and attracted investment but have recently seen activity actually stall due to larger structural issues. 
* Renewables targets in combination with auctions or feed-in tariff are the initial policy measures that have enabled the majority Capacity-Builders to move into this group and can be credited for most of the $709 billion invested across the 71 Climatescope countries between 2011 and 2016.
* The experience of the Ceiling-Hitters and some Capacity-Builders highlights the importance of taking a comprehensive approach to energy sector policy making to account for rapidly evolving demand patterns and the progress renewables have achieved. Ceiling-Hitter nations also often highlight the large investments required to expand grids and, in turn, ease renewable integration. At the other end of the spectrum, the right policies in markets with low electrification rates can avoid the need for large capital projects by instead supporting cost-effective distributed energy. 
* In light of the dual challenges of improving energy access and addressing climate change, the fact that no less than 27 countries can still be considered Slow-Starters is alarming. National governments and development organizations are today spoiled for choices when it comes to policy lessons learned in developing nations.
* Country level examples of policy innovation include:
  - Mexico and its novel reverse tender system, which advantages developers who choose to build projects in under-supplied regions while disadvantaging those who go where supply is already abundant.
  - China and its plan to invest $270 billion to improve transmission and distribution through 2020, including 144GW of long-distance high-voltage lines. China is also slowly liberalizing its power markets so that buyers and sellers may someday negotiate not just on price but also, importantly, on the volume of electricity to be delivered.
  - Central America and its SIEPAC regional grid and accompanying Mercado Eléctrico Regional, which are enabling clean energy to flow freely across national borders to the region's seven nations. 
  - Peru and Rwanda, whose efforts to boost energy access include holding tenders in which off-grid developers/distributors compete for the right to provide electricity to millions, and other initiatives. Peru has already boosted its rural electrification rate from 29% in 2015 to over 78%.

## Clean energy policy and deployment

Since 2010, developing countries have collectively accounted for a larger share of clean energy investment and deployment than wealthier countries. 2015 was a record year for both investment and installations with $165 billion (Figure 2) flowing to the sector and 67GW of generation capacity added to power systems across the 71 emerging markets reviewed in Climatescope (Figure 3). The sharp reduction in investment in 2016, the year following the Paris climate conference where over 200 nations came together and agreed to address climate change, is troubling. However, there is also evidence suggesting that 2017 and 2018 could see activity pick up again. Record investment in onshore wind in 2014 and 2015 is likely to translate into strong build in 2017 as there is a lag between when capital is deployed and projects are completed. Investment volumes in solar is where cost reduction impacts are most evident<sup>1</sup> and yearly installation levels continue to grow from record to record even when dollar volumes don’t rise.

Growing renewables deployment in emerging markets is all the more critical as they also lead in building the most new fossil fuel capacity to meet the demands of their growing economies (Figure 4). Unlike developing countries, the world’s most developed countries are decarbonizing their energy systems at a much faster pace thanks to the combination of flat demand, fossil fuel power plant retirements and more affordable renewables.

The current scale of renewables activity was brought about by conducive policy environments in a group of front-running countries. China met the European Union’s and its own early renewables deployment ambition by introducing generous feed-in tariffs and massively supporting growth of its renewables technology manufacturing capacity. Brazil ambitioned to fuel what was an economic boom from 2002-2011 at least in part with clean energy and introduced a program to hold auctions for clean power delivery contracts.  Such tender systems are rapidly becoming the norm in top tier markets around the world.

Yet, the 2016 investment figures indicate that a number of the busiest renewables markets of recent years are hitting what appear to be ceilings as the infrastructure and regulation needed to integrate all this capacity is being deployed. The data also highlight that clean energy investment is concentrated in a relatively small group of nations with the number of emerging markets recording in excess of $100 million in investment in any one year stagnating at around 27 since 2010. 

This note focuses on the policies that have enabled countries to jump-start clean energy activity, and on innovative measures introduced by those that have hit infrastructure and/or regulatory ceilings limiting further renewables deployment. 

### Initial power sector policies for clean energy deployment

Evidence from the 71 countries reviewed for Climatescope is clear: countries where responsibility for generation, transmission and distribution rest with a single fully-integrated monopolistic company are generally not conducive to renewables investment (Table 1). In fact, countries with such structures often have difficulty attracting private capital in general.

**Table 1:** Renewables investment in Climatescope countries by power market concentration and unbundling group 

== add table  == 	

<small>*Source: Bloomberg New Energy Finance*</small>

From 2012-2016, just $831 million in clean energy capital was deployed in countries with power systems monopolized by a single state-owned player . That represents just 0.1% of all funds deployed during that period for renewables. There are certainly reasons why incumbent monopolistic utilities might resist liberalization and the associated proliferation of renewables.  They need look no further than developed countries where major utility companies are being challenged by wind and solar, in particular.  Conversely, for policy-makers, the most obvious rational for liberalizing generation is to foster competition, attract clean energy, and see prices drop for consumers. 

Liberalizing the generation segment of the market need not preclude state-owned companies from participating in renewables development. Brazil and China are both examples where majority state-owned companies are co-existing with and competing against private project developers. Many majority state-owned utilities from developed and developing countries are now also using their size to invest internationally (ADD LINK FOR INVESTMENT PIECE).

**Figure 5:** Countries with clean energy policies implemented

Beyond market liberalization, renewables typically require additional support to gain a foothold in new markets, particularly where incumbent, fossil-produced power is being subsidized. Climatescope has been tracking the implementation of such policies in a growing list of developing countries (Figure 5), starting with Latin American nations in 2012.  More countries were added in 2015 and this the list year expanded to 71 countries in Latin America, Middle East and North Africa, and Asia.    

**Targets** are the starting point of most renewable energy policy frameworks. The number of countries that have introduced them has grown considerably from 2014 through 2016 as governments grow more aware of the opportunities lower-cost of renewables offer and the urgency of reducing power sector emissions. Three out of four Climatescope countries reviewed now have targets on their books.

**Tax incentives** are the second most popular renewables support mechanism in emerging markets and their popularity predates the recent way of renewables targets. This can partly be explained by the formerly high cost of renewables and the relatively low levels of deployment. Indeed, from a government’s perspective, tax incentives are not terribly costly so long as build/investment levels and the associated tax collections are low. Tax incentives are thus a relatively blunt mechanism that when not combined with other incentives can see their costs rise as deployment levels grow. It is also worth noting that such incentives can typically be removed easiest as tax policies are often reviewed annually. India and member countries of the East African Community are examples of markets where tax holidays for renewables are being reviewed in response to growing activity in the sector.

**Debt incentives**, rather than often underfunded **equity incentives**, have proven to be extremely effective when they are well designed as they address the major challenge of access and cost of finance in emerging markets. Brazil's national development bank BNDES dominates clean energy lending thanks to the below-market rates and generous terms. The goal: incentivize development of a domestic onshore wind value chain. Lebanon’s central bank’s zero-rate lending program for PV projects is also a noteworthy success as it focuses on smaller scale projects.

**Utility regulations** include a wide group of policies. The ones known to drive clean energy deployment most are ambitious renewables portfolio standards and green certificate markets. However, their use is relatively limited in emerging markets to date. Of the 17 Climatescope countries that have utility regulations in place, most have introduced policies like priority grid access and guaranteed purchase rules in favor of renewables. These policies can play an important role in helping renewables developers but cannot support growth in the sector on their own.

**Feed-in tariffs (FiTs)** and **auctions** are the policies that have supported the vast majority of renewables procurement globally to date. Emerging markets, Brazil and the rest of Latin America in particular, have pioneered the use of auctions that invite developers to bid to sell their power at least cost. Tenders for power contracts are by no means new in the context of emerging markets, however. What has been novel is the extension of these to renewables specifically. In contrast, the reputation of FiTs set by regulators has suffered in recent years in the wake of the European experience. In some EU countries, generously priced FiTs prompted unexpectedly large and sudden booms in renewable build. This, in turn, resulted in ballooning public subsidy liabilities and put considerable pressure on electricity bills or government budgets. However, FiTs can play an important role in supporting small-scale projects for which the costs of organizing auctions can be prohibitive.

### Clean energy auctions: from Latin America to a global phenomenon

The popularity of clean energy auctions has grown globally to developing and developed nations alike, but the trend clearly began in emerging markets (Figure 6). Contracts auctioned globally more than doubled from 12.9GW in 2015 to 34.2GW in 2016, and the 2016 volume was already matched in the first six months of 2017. 

**Figure 6:** Cumulative global auctioned capacity

Policy-makers and developers alike are generally attracted to well-organized auctions because, at their best, they offer transparency, foster competition, and produce affordably-priced power contracts. This has resulted in dramatic cost reductions across the vast majority of the markets where they have been introduced (Figure 7). Auctions for solar power delivery contracts in particular have allowed governments to reap benefits from continued cost declines from the trend toward commoditization of photovoltaic modules. 

Progress for onshore wind sector has trended similarly to larger infrastructure projects as wind project costs are more linked to local operating conditions, which can often be difficult in emerging markets (ADD LINK TP RISK ANALYSIS). Nevertheless, it is important to note that clearing prices alone do not show the full extent of the progress made in the wind industry which has delivered remarkable improvements in capacity factors thanks to ever bigger turbines and better wind forecasting. 

**Figure 7:** Global clean energy auction clearing prices and awarded contract volumes

Record low auctions prices for solar and wind are turning the century-old cost relationship between fossil fuel and renewables upside down in a rapidly growing number of markets. India’s adoption of auctions has given birth to the most competitive renewables market in the world.

Receiving bids to provide 10 times as much power as tendered was the norm in most solar auctions in India in 2016 where more than 4GW being auctioned. High competition has resulted in solar and wind project developers committing to deliver electricity at prices below the cost of coal generation by 2020 (Figure 8). These bids have major implications for India, the coal industry, and the world at large given India’s current and future role in CO2 emissions. The Indian government has already responded to these bids by reducing its coal-fired power generating ambitions in favor of renewables. 

It should be noted that the intense competition and extreme low bids in India are raising questions about whether current market dynamics are sustainable. Auction bids are formulated and submitted years before development starts and developers appear to operate under the assumption that solar equipment prices can only fall in the future when there is at least the possibility of a price uptick, at least temporarily, at some point due to supply bottlenecks or other issues. Bids should start to rise as developers adapt to changing market conditions or react as projects that had previously won bids get cancelled. 

Given the critical role solar is poised to play in helping India expand energy access, the government will need to watch closely for signs of irrational bidding as the country’s auction program is growing at an unprecedented pace. This is particularly true as India's often undercapitalized banks are now more exposed than ever to renewables.

Away from India, there are many other examples of where clean energy is undercutting fossil fuel based generation. In Chile, renewables have for years won power supply contracts in technology-neutral auctions competing directly with fossil-fueled plants. The remarkable cost reductions delivered by the renewables supply chain and the pull effect of auctions have succeeded in solving the affordability challenge of clean energy deployment. This even holds true for markets that have recorded little clean energy sector activity to date as was shown with the recent bids recorded across the Middle East and earlier in South Africa. 

In light of the dual challenges of improving energy access and addressing climate change, the fact that such a large group of countries still is recording little to no investment is alarming. National governments and development organizations are today spoiled for choices when it comes to lessons learned. The rest of this analysis focuses on policies and regulations required to scale renewables while addressing challenges that can accompany them.

## Cracking the renewables deployment ceiling

Most of the 16 nations that scored 1.75 (out of 5) or higher in this year's survey have taken key policy steps to attract investment and deploy large volumes of renewables successfully.  These countries have recorded clean energy investment and deployment activity at least equivalent and sometimes larger than those seen in Germany, the self-proclaimed energy transition global leader, or the U.S. (Figure 9 and Figure 10).

One of the main challenges to increasing renewables at this pace is their technical and financial integration with the energy system and the economy at large. Indeed, renewables deployment targets to date have seldom been designed with overall electricity supply and demand dynamics in mind. Sometimes decisions are taken in two or more different ministries which both want the best for the portfolio of sectors they oversee. 

A comprehensive approach to energy policy-making has always been critical.  But the challenge of doing so now is arguably taller than ever as rapidly falling costs and evolving innovation create ever-changing circumstances with wide-ranging implications. There are also the challenges associated with conventional institutional thinking; some policy-makers still resist the idea that power-generation can be de-centralized, not necessarily available 24 hours a day, or fired by fossil fuels.

### Electricity demand and renewables deployment

As they grow and mature, economies tend to become more energy efficient. For most developed countries, this is the result progressing away from energy-intensive industrial activity to more services-oriented activities. The energy efficiency of emerging market nations is expected to catch up with wealthier countries as they grow and shift toward services (Figure 11).

**Figure 11:** OECD vs. non-OECD projected electricity intensity: BNEF Outlook

== add figure  ==

However, rapid development in technology and the increasing digitalization brought about by the Internet are challenging the theory of a steady transition from agriculture to industry and to services. Countries like India, Nigeria, Morocco or Kenya are all home to booming IT sectors while their industrial activity is seeing more modest growth. The electricity consumption of electronics has gone through an efficiency revolution of its own since the 1990s. A typical set of home appliances consumes less than a third of the energy it did back then (Figure 12).


**Figure 12:** Home appliance energy consumption and efficiency improvements

The aggregate impact of these improvements is huge. Two decades ago, meeting the basic power needs of the 1.2 billion people without access would require just under 500TWh per year – equivalent to the demand of a mid-sized G20 country such as South Korea. With modern appliances, the same service today would require just under 30% of what it did back then. 

### Regulator and utility forecasting woes

Changing consumption trends are creating major headaches in all segments of the energy world. But the challenges may be most acute in the power sector where regulators and utilities are tasked with guaranteeing energy supply at optimal cost while anticipating their economy’s future electricity needs.

By default, regulators and utilities have tended to be overly bullish about future demand growth. In liberalized systems, this can lead to severe distress for investors as market gluts lower revenue until excess capacity is removed or demand recovers (such as in Brazil during the most recent recession). 

Figure 13 shows the challenges Indonesia’s state-owned utility Perusahaan Listrik Negar (PLN) has had forecasting demand in recent years. The growth rate it forecasts for the next decade is 30-90% higher than growth seen in the last decade. This is despite the fact that Indonesia has seen less expansion of energy-intensive manufacturing in recent years than in less intensive telecommunications. The utility’s miscalculations have had severe consequences on the financial balances in the energy sector. PLN is heavily indebted and is considered at risk of default by the country’s finance ministry despite receiving large, repeated capital injections. This in turn creates challenges for renewables development simply because funds are lacking and adding them to an already oversupplied system would further reduce the utilization of the existing generation fleet.

### India’s search for load

One positive response to the challenge of over-supply is to add demand by expanding energy access to populations yet to be connected to the grid. Along those lines, India’s government has paired its large-renewables procurement goal with a $14.2 billion electrification program which has the ambitious goal of electrifying all the villages in the country by the end of 2017, and to enter all homes by year-end 2018 (Figure 14 and Figure 15). The plan is expected to provide an additional 80TWh of electricity and boost demand 7% from 2016 levels.

Note: the achievement (in %) is against the target of villages for the respective state which was un-electrified on April 1, 2015.

The number of households is as per the data reported by the Rural Electrification Corporation in November 2017 and represents only rural households.*</small>

Distances between demand centers and where renewable power generation makes most sense add a further layer of complexity. Locations with the best solar radiation or strongest winds are best can be inhospitable even uninhabitable. This forces policy-makers to come up with novel solutions.

### China’s East-West demand and supply mismatch 

Much of China’s installed 244GW of solar and wind has been deployed in the country’s northwestern area where natural resources are best. However, this is also furthest from the country’s very largest demand centers to the east. Developers went northwest in search of highest yields on a FiT scheme that applied uniformly across the country, much the way Germany developers built projects in the windiest north of that country, away from consumption centers. 

Record deployment in China has led to rising curtailment rates and losses of revenues for generators in the most affected regions (Figure 16). At 17% for onshore wind in 2016, and 10% for solar, China’s renewables curtailment levels are the worst in the world. The size of the government’s response is in line with the ambition of adding over 100GW of generating capacity to the system every year. Between 2016 and 2020, China aims to invest $270 billion in its transmission and distribution networks (3% of 2016 GDP). The budget includes investment in 144GW of long-distance high-voltage transmission lines, by far the largest deployment of such infrastructure in the world to date. In July 2016, the Chinese government also introduced an “onshore wind investment risk alert” which effectively put a hold on new build in the western provinces with high curtailment. A similar mechanism was introduced for solar in the summer of 2017. As a result, BNEF expects western curtailment risk to fall by 2020. 

**Figure 16:**  China generation curtailment risk

Governments with lofty renewables goals today can look to China as an example of why policy supports should often have some degree of geographic specificity. But the country is also in the process of demonstrating how geographic biases can get resolved longer term. 

### Mexico’s comprehensive solution to renewables deployment 

For its part, Mexico has explicitly sought to differentiate government support provided to clean energy projects in different parts of the country based on need. Launched in 2013, the country’s major energy sector reform exemplifies not just how risks of overbuild in specific regions can be mitigated, but how policies can be structured to fully leverage resources.

Specifically, Mexico has a unique system for tendering clean power-delivery contracts. This mechanism includes an explicit nodal price adjustment provided to incentivize developers to locate projects near nodes where generation is less readily available.  The system also essentially discourages new projects where supply exceeds demand. 

After being received by the regulator, each bid is adjusted for the purposes of determining the potential winner by the nodal factor, but the adjustment does not affect the actual price in the PPA signed by winning developers. For example, a project located in an area with sufficient generation that has a nodal difference of $5/MWh and bids $40/MWh will compete against other bids as if its offer was $45/MWh. On the other hand, a project located in a region with a supply shortage will see $5/MWh discounted from $40/MWh and valued as if it were $35/MWh in the auction-clearing process. This second project will win a $40/MWh PPA. 

The first three auctions held in Mexico have succeeded in addressing many of the supply imbalances reported by the regulator (Figure 17). In the first auction, nodal differences ranged from +$10.7 to -$34.3. This $45 gap between highest and the lowest nodes decisively affected the winning projects list. Half of the contracts awarded in this first auction went to projects located in the two states with the highest nodal discounts: Yucatán and Baja California Sur. The third auction held a year later saw the range between nodes reduced to $13.5 as a result of the success of the previous rounds.
