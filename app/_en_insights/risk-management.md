Every renewable energy project entails risk, but one in an emerging market can bring more and different types of risk. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, although there are many instruments available on the market – for a price. And sometimes a tool is not necessary. This commentary focuses on the higher and different risks faced when developing a renewables project in the 71 emerging markets covered by the 2017 Global Climatescope project (the red lightning bolts in Figure 1).

### Key findings

* The use of political risk insurance and other types of guarantee has been limited for renewables. Reasons include high costs, complex application processes, preference for large projects, limited coverage, lack of awareness of the available tools, long processing times and stringent eligibility criteria.

*	A sovereign guarantee might appear the Holy Grail for offtaker risk, but it is only as good as the government’s balance sheet, as found in Tanzania. A developer may secure a partial risk guarantee, though only debt lenders will be covered and only if the offtaker is state-owned. 

* Companies vary in their use of currency hedging instruments: Enel prefers forward contracts and Canadian Solar also uses the more flexible but also more expensive options. EDF keeps its foreign exchange positions open if no instruments are available, or if hedging costs are prohibitive, and instead it monitors the risk on such positions using sensitivity calculations.  

* Risk mitigation does not always mean purchasing an instrument of some kind: for example, a favorably negotiated power-purchase agreement (PPA) can help manage the risk of currency fluctuation, interest rate increases and curtailment. 

* A geographically diversified portfolio of projects may reduce a developer’s political risk, while partnership with a local company and strategies to increase local buy-in may alleviate the risk of disputes over land ownership. Renewables developers vary in their geographic and technological diversification (Figure 2).

*	Sometimes the risk mitigation is mostly out of the hands of the developer: the government can help manage currency fluctuation for developers by paying tariffs in U.S. dollars (eg, Chile) or using a fixed exchange rate (eg, Ghana, Jordan).

## Political risk

A renewables developer or investor in an emerging economy may face an increased risk that its returns or earnings could decline as a result of political changes, such as war and terrorism, expropriation, and sovereign breach of contract. Renewable energy projects are particularly exposed to the risk of a change in law or policy, given their current reliance on government subsidies. For example, in 2013, the Indonesian government introduced a solar auction program, aimed at developing the country’s solar power capacity through regular tenders. A year after its introduction the program was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and closed, after the association of PV manufacturers sued the government for allowing foreign equipment to be used at all. 

### Political risk: Ukraine

Wind and solar capacity additions in Ukraine ground to a halt in 2014, with the 100-day revolution, Russia’s annexation of Crimea and start of the war in Donbas.  

Investors began to return to the market in 2016 when the economy stabilized and the government made some favorable changes to the green tariff.

The main strategy for mitigating political risk in the power sector is to buy some form of targeted insurance or guarantee. For example, the World Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) supplied political risk insurance for the 47MW Rajamandala small hydro project in Indonesia. Instead, a renewables project may rely simply on a bilateral investment treaty between the project and developer’s home countries. Where there is no such treaty, investors may sign host government agreements with stabilization clauses specifying that for the duration of the project, the relevant legislation will remain the same. Such clauses may also require the government indemnify investors of the cost of complying with any changes in law. One renewable energy example was in Ukraine with regard to the renewables feed-in tariff. 

Such tools should enable developers to secure financing more easily or at least on better terms. In addition, some providers – particularly public ones – can influence the host government and help prevent adverse events or secure preferential treatment for investors. However, these mechanisms raise challenges:

* Coverage may be limited and contract language may be ambiguous.

* The insurance or guarantee provider may impose stringent social, economic and environmental criteria. 

* Some tools are expensive and only cover a share of the investment.

* It can be time-consuming to secure an instrument or to structure an investment to benefit from a given treaty. 

* With a bilateral investment treaty, winning an award against a country does not automatically mean payment. 

* They have also been criticized for focusing on protecting foreign investors, without taking account of the national conditions. 

* Historically there have been issues around the enforceability of stabilization clauses. 

## PPA

This risk arises when a developer encounters barriers to securing a PPA, or a deal may be reached but at a later date the government or utility wishes to renegotiate the terms (see box). 

### PPA risk: South Africa

Participants in South Africa’s renewables auction program have faced considerable policy uncertainty in the last two years, after the offtaker, Eskom, refused to sign PPAs for 27 renewables projects that had won preferred bidder status in 2015. These deals were due to be signed by October 28, 2017 – but at lower tariffs – the former Energy Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi announced on September 1. This deadline has now been moved to November 20, according to media reports. This policy uncertainty has caused South Africa to drop one place in Climatescope 2017 to sixth position. Focusing only on its enabling framework, the country saw a 9% decrease in its score in 2017.

There are a few mechanisms to protect the developer against PPA risk, with one being a partial risk or credit guarantee (see below). However, such instruments bring the challenges outlined above, as well as only being applicable where the offtaker is state-owned. Another way to mitigate PPA risk is for a developer to sign a put-and-call option agreement with the government (Figure 4). In April 2017, the Nigerian government signed such deals with two local solar developers, which are planning to build two PV plants totaling 120MW. This West African nation has risen to 24th place in Climatescope 2017 from 30th in the 2016 edition.

On the down side, such agreements can be expensive and some countries such as Russia do not recognize put or call options. In addition, the termination payments will depend on the reason why the PPA ended. In the case of Nigeria, the outstanding debt will be paid back in full but the equity investment may be recovered in full or impaired, depending on the case of the termination. 

### Offtaker risk: Argentina

When it launched its RenovAr renewables auction program a few years ago, investors were concerned about sovereign and offtaker risk. As a result, it created the national renewable energy trust fund ‘Foder’, which offers auction winners both a liquidity and termination guarantee, protecting the companies from offtaker, PPA, currency convertibility and certain political risks. 

## Currency fluctuation

Developing countries account for 46 of the 50 most volatile currencies over the last five years (Figure 5). Currency fluctuation or devaluation risk for a renewables project arises from the mismatch between the currency of payment in the PPA and that of obligations for operating expenses, taxes, loan repayments on the one hand, and dividend payments and profit repatriation on the other. Developers and investors will therefore try to mitigate the risk or price it into their tariffs. Problems can also arise if the PPA tariff uses a fixed exchange rate (see box).

### Currency fluctuation risk: Egypt

The Egyptian pound has halved relative to the U.S. dollar since currency controls were scrapped in November 2016 (Figure 6).  Feed-in tariff participants are partially shielded from the currency risk as the majority of the dollar-denominated tariff is paid (in pounds) at the prevailing exchange rate. However, another part (30% for PV, 40% for wind) is paid at a fixed exchange rate. This fixed rate, of 8.88 pounds per dollar is far from the current rate, which has stabilized at around 17-18 pounds since March.

One of the main areas of exposure to currency risk relates to the source of financing. Developers can therefore help mitigate these risks by:

* Obtaining debt financing in local currency and using domestic equipment. 
* Taking on a loan denominated in local currency from a lender based outside the host country. 
*	Securing a local-currency loan and hedging the risk by using an international hedge provider such as the TCX Currency Fund.
*	Using a back-to-back structure where the developer borrows from an outside lender in the form of dollar-denominated loan and uses the dollar proceeds of the loan as collateral to obtain a local-currency-denominated loan from a local bank. 

A developer may purchase a sometimes expensive risk-hedging instrument such as a currency swap (Figure 7). Forward/futures contracts are easier to manage and have a lower upfront cost but locking in a fixed forward price can be expensive if the currency moves against the contract holder. Options offer more flexibility, although premiums can be high.
