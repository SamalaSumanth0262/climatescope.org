Climatescope is a unique country-by-country assessment, interactive report and index that evaluates the investment conditions for clean energy in emerging markets. It profiles 104 markets worldwide and evaluates their ability to attract capital for low-carbon energy sources while building a greener economy. Climatescope is a snapshot of where clean energy policy and finance stand today, and a guide to what can happen in the future.

This marks the eighth year of the Climatescope project. In 2012 and 2013, Climatescope focused exclusively on Latin America and the Caribbean. The first edition was developed by the Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-American Development Bank Group in partnership with BloombergNEF.

From 2014 to 2016, the UK Department for International Development and the US Agency for International Development joined as supporters and advisors. The project was expanded to include 58 countries, states, and provinces in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The coverage was expanded further to include three countries from the Middle East and North Africa, as well as with an updated methodology for the off-grid energy coverage. In 2017, an additional 13 countries in Central Europe and Asia were added, bringing the total number of countries to 71.

In 2018, the project was expanded and updated in two key ways. First, the total number of countries surveyed was expanded significantly to 103. This included 100 nations classified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as less developed. It also included three countries – Chile, Mexico, and Turkey – that are an important part of the developing-nation story but are not technically classified as non-OECD. As a result of this expansion, Climatescope now offers a comprehensive snapshot of virtually all developing nations. Now, in 2019, Qatar was added to the list, increasing the number of markets covered to 104. 

This year’s Climatescope Emerging Market Outlook represents the collective effort of 45 BloombergNEF analysts who made 23 country visits to collect data and conduct interviews. Once again, the study has been graciously supported by the U.K. Department for International Development.
