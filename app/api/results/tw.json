energy policy","value":"Taiwan�s feed-in tariffs helped expand renewable energy capacity to 8.8GW by the end of 2018. The new administration, which came to power in 2016, launched an aggressive energy transition plan to phase out nuclear by 2025 while adding 25GW of renewables. Though most of the residents were in favor of extending the life of nuclear power in a referendum at the end of 2018, the administration is keeping to its promise of phasing out nuclear by 2025. Lucrative offshore wind feed-in tariffs (FiT) have attracted major European developers and financiers from Taiwan and overseas. The government�s proposed steep cuts to 2019 FiT rates, though subsequently softened, demonstrated material revenue risks. Solar installations exceeded 1GW in 2018 on the back of strong rooftop promotion programs, though long-term challenges in land acquisition for utility-scale projects remain."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Solar has so far attracted most of the clean energy investment in Taiwan though investment in wind is poised to grow fast, largely because the government auctioned 5.5GW of offshore capacity in 2018. Taiwan�s local banks have lent to solar projects, and are becoming comfortable with offshore wind assets. In June 2019, Orsted secured a NT$25 billion ($806 million) loan facility for its offshore wind projects in Taiwan, one of the biggest clean energy deals globally in 1H 2019. Some 15 Taiwan and international banks are part of the syndicated loan agreement."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Taiwan offers some of the world�s cheapest retail power prices � a deliberate government policy to benefit semiconductor and other manufacturing industries. In 2017, the residential tariff was the third lowest and the industrial tariff the sixth lowest according to Taipower, the vertically integrated utility that owns 64% of Taiwan�s total power capacity, and the International Energy Agency. The utility raised the average retail tariff by 3% in April 2018 for the first time in four years; industry and large commercial companies will feel the brunt of the increase, while 80% of residents and small businesses are not affected. Adding new and more expensive renewables and gas generation will further stress Taipower's balance sheet as the cost cannot be fully passed on to end-consumers."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Coal accounted for nearly half of Taiwan�s power generation in 2018. This position is likely to change with the government�s energy transition set to increase the share of gas power to 50% and renewables to 20% of total generation by 2025 while phasing out nuclear power, which accounted for 10% of generation in 2018. To spur accelerated growth, policies have been introduced to give renewable energy priority dispatch and permission to be sold directly to end-users on the unregulated market, with Facebook signing the island�s first corporate renewable power purchase agreement in January 2019. Fossil fuel generators can only sell power to Taipower. Liberalization for thermal generators is due to take effect in 5-8 years."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Taiwan�s power demand is only expected to grow modestly at 1.6% in the next two decades, according to Taiwan Research Institute. Yet the government�s intention to take all the 5.1GW nuclear power capacity offline by 2025 creates opportunities for renewable energy. The island has been receptive to foreign players, granting three-quarters of the 3.8GW offshore wind capacity announced in April 2018 to overseas developers. The government is also working with global supply chain companies to establish a local offshore wind manufacturing hub. Overseas banks have also participated in project financing."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Regulators do not allow Taiwanese companies to import solar cells and wind turbines from mainland China, slowing down the decrease in project capex and levelized costs made possible by the mainland market�s massive scale. Local so-called Nimby (Not-in-my-backyard) movements, taking the form of environmental protectionism, and land transfer challenges, are significant barriers for project implementation. Taipower has modified the feed-in tariff rules at least twice before: in 2010 to shorten the commissioning deadline for solar auction winners, and then in 2012-13, to renegotiate tariffs with thermal IPPs. The Ministry of Economic Affairs also cut the 2019 offshore wind FiT, lowering the revenue for developers who secured projects in 2018, yet failed to sign power purchase agreements with Taipower before year-end. These changes increase the risks of investing in renewables in Taiwan."}]}
