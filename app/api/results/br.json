energy policy","value":"Since 2009, Brazil has implemented reverse auctions to contract new clean energy generation capacity to supply the regulated utility market. The country pioneered competitive auctions, which led to over 28GW of renewable energy contracted, despite a tender hiatus from May 2016 to December 2017. Auctions started again in late 2017, and six rounds were held between December 2017 and October 2019. Sharp competition among project developers resulted in the lowest average solar auction price ever recorded in Brazil of $17.5/MWh in July 2019. In terms of other renewables incentives, retail electricity customers may install self-generation facilities, connect to the grid, deliver surplus generation and obtain compensation in the form of a subsequent billing credit. Distributed PV capacity reached 1GW in June 2019, doubling from 508MW at year-end 2018. However, the boom has prompted a rethink about appropriate regulation and retail tariff design and the country�s regulator, ANEEL, is reviewing net metering rules."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Brazil attracted almost $56 billion in new asset finance for clean energy plants in 2009-18, by far the largest amount in Latin America over the period. Wind alone accounts for 54% of the total, while solar attracted 8%. The solar share should increase as developers secured almost 2.5GW in contracts in the 2017-19 auctions. Brazilian national development bank BNDES has played a major role in the development of the country�s renewable energy market. The bank is the top global lender to clean energy, having disbursed $23.5 billion for renewable energy projects (excluding large hydro) between 2009 and 2018. However, the bank had changed the methodology it uses to calculate interest rates. Those are now slated to increase gradually for new loans until 2023 when they reach par with commercial levels. Between now and then, we expect BNDES�s contributions to fade somewhat as private capital takes a more prominent role."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail electricity prices (in local currency terms) jumped an average of 81% between 2010 and 2018 for the three customer classes of commercial, industrial and residential. This was mainly due to inflation and decreased hydropower generation. In 2018, Brazil�s retail tariffs were among the six highest in Latin America, at $195/MWh for commercial, $168/MWh for industrial and $196/MWh for residential. Commercial and industrial (C&I) customers with power demand greater than 500kW are eligible to purchase electricity from Brazil�s deregulated wholesale market. Consumers with demand between 500kW and 3MW choosing this option must purchase wholesale power generated from incentivized renewable sources, including wind, small hydro, biomass and solar."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Brazil has the largest power market in Latin America, with total installed capacity of 162GW in 2018. The country�s size, plentiful resources and conducive policies have made Brazil the region�s main renewable energy market and one of the top 10 in the world. Its matrix remains highly reliant on hydropower, which accounted for roughly 65% of the country�s generation in 2018. The heavy reliance on one source came at a high cost in 2014: a prolonged drought put Brazil�s water supply and energy matrix into stress, exposing the market to costly generation from fossil-fueled plants. The hydro crisis emphasized the country�s need for generation diversification. Auctions and net metering will continue to be crucial policies to develop Brazil�s power sector. In terms of structure, the power market is fully unbundled and fairly evenly split between state-owned and private-sector players."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Latin America�s largest economy is restrained by tepid growth as it limps back from a deep recession in 2015-16. Brazil�s GDP expanded just 1.1% in 2018, and growth has remained near 1% for the past two and a half years. Sluggish growth is expected to persist through the end of 2019, with annual GDP growth forecast cut from 2.4% in March to 0.8% in September. Unemployment remains high, productivity lags and public debt has risen. Inflation has grown slower than anticipated and is expected to end 2019 at 3.6% vs. a target of 4.25%."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"In October 2018, Brazil elected former military officer and far-right politician Jair Messias Bolsonaro of the Social Liberal Party (PSL) as its 42nd president. After a polarizing campaign, the results represent a repudiation of traditional politics in the country and of entrenched corruption, as well as a reaction to high levels of violent crime and ongoing economic woes. Bolsonaro�s focus on the energy sector as a key driver of growth and development, as well as his emphasis on partially privatizing state-owned companies and regaining investor confidence could bring a bright future for renewables in the country."}]}
