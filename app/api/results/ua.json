energy policy","value":"Ukraine aims to reach an 11% share of renewables in power generation by 2020. A generous feed-in tariff, tax incentives for the import of renewables-related equipment and a break on corporate tax for sales of electricity from renewable sources have spurred a surge in build since 2017.  Ukraine�s new Electricity Law, which came into full effect in July 2019, establishes an ongoing framework to spur the growth of renewables and features a tender/auction program expected to start in late 2019. The law also liberalizes the power market, clarifies the offtaker�s role and establishes a framework for standardized power purchase agreements.  This has boosted investor confidence, which was undermined by political instability over the past decade and territorial conflict with Russia."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Recent regulatory and legislative reforms have spurred rising clean energy investments in Ukraine, which attracted more than $4 billion in 2018 and 1H 2019 alone. The biggest investments so far have been made by local developers led by Ukraine�s largest non-state utility DTEK and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has gone to lengths to present Ukraine as lower risk than previously perceived. U.S.-based Overseas Private Investment Corporation offers insurance against political risk for some energy investments, and the feed-in tariff is backed by a sovereign guarantee which also boosts investor confidence. Solar and wind projects have attracted similar levels of financing over 2018-19."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices in Ukraine were regulated until the introduction of a wholesale market in 2019. New market rules have not brought full liberalization, however, as some state-owned power is price-capped to keep residential electricity tariffs low. The wholesale market is still heavily concentrated and dominated by fossil fuel plants owned by DTEK. To avoid excessive volatility, the wholesale market is operated with price caps. Both thermal and nuclear plants are in need of investment for renewal and life extension. It is unclear how this will be funded and how retail prices will change if and when price caps are lifted.  Ukraine�s situation is further complicated by a shortfall in coal supplies from the east of the country, which has been destabilized by conflict with Russia. Coal imports have partially compensated for this, while some plants are retrofitting to run on gas instead."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Nuclear plants supplied more than half the electricity generated in Ukraine in 2018 � a proportion that has increased in recent years. Non-hydro renewables account for just over 3% of generation � a proportion that is likely to increase with the growing renewables pipeline. The upcoming power auctions could slow that growth rate, however, depending on the quota of capacity on offer. The new power market structure will require further price liberalization to incentivize independent power producers to enter the market. Generation is only partially privatized, and DTEK is by far the largest single player."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand in Ukraine fell after the 2014 Russian annexation of Ukrainian Crimea, and ongoing militarization of eastern Ukraine has led to major economic volatility and a longer term slowdown. Demand has revived somewhat since 2016, as parts of the country have stabilized and returned to growth. The current generation fleet has been adequate to serve the national market, but Soviet-era nuclear assets must either be upgraded or replaced. The government�s drive to improve the energy efficiency of housing and public buildings is expected to limit increases in demand while renewables are developed. The aim is to lower Ukraine�s dependence on Russian gas for its power and heating needs. The south of Ukraine has good solar resources, which has drawn investors to regions such as Odessa. Wind resources also are good in several areas. The distribution and transmission system will require major investment to integrate growing renewables capacity."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"There are restrictions on the use of agricultural land for renewables projects and on the production of bioethanol by foreign companies. There also are untested rules around the ownership of strategically important energy assets by foreign companies. Probably of greater concern are risk perceptions. Political fears subsided after national elections of early 2019 took place with relative transparency and uncontested results. The country still ranks poorly in international corruption assessments. Currency fluctuations have been a barrier to renewables deployment, though the feed-in tariff was linked to the euro to circumvent this issue. The administrative burden on foreign companies remains onerous."}]}
