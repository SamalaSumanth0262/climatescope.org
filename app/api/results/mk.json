energy policy","value":"In April 2017, the Republic of Macedonia amended its National Renewable Energy Action Plan issued in 2012, lowering its target to source 28% of generation from renewable sources by 2020 to an achievable 24%. The original target has been pushed back to 2030. The country has little in the way of renewable energy policies besides a feed-in tariff, which entitles operators of PV installations to conclude 15-year PPAs. The agreements’ standard tenor is extended to 20 years for both hydro and wind power plants, and electricity suppliers are required to purchase the producers’ generation for the agreement’s duration."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Macedonia was the first country in the Western Balkans to erect a sizeable wind farm – a 36.8MW project at Bogdanci. The government is offering concessions for investors looking into funding small hydropower plants. Finance for wind and small hydro projects has mainly come from such international concessional donors as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, with local developers or the state utility providing smaller equity stakes. However, the current administration’s focus appears set on channeling investment into non-renewables sources, whether in bolstering coal and gas-derived capacity or attempting to attract investors to construct three new large hydro facilities."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Macedonia has some of the lowest electricity prices in Europe, with residential bills amounting to less than half that of the European average. Tariffs are gradually increasing due to the progressing electrification of household heating. The domestically sourced lignite currently providing well over half of the country’s power is running out, leading to renewed interest in bolstering natural gas’ share of the energy mix. Even if two mooted lignite mines are opened, the country will likely have to import over half of its coal production by 2030. Higher logistical expenses and steeper production costs anticipated for new mines are expected to push up operating outlays, putting further pressure on power prices."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The Macedonian power sector has been unbundled and partially privatized. ELEM’s monopoly on generation ended in 2008 insofar as big industrial consumers are concerned (and, since 2014, 230 companies with annual revenues of at least 10 million euros ($11.38 million) are allowed to choose their supplier). Thanks to the government’s adoption of an energy law in April 2018, this choice will be extended to small firms and households from 2019. Yet ELEM maintains control of the country’s two major coal power stations, with a total capacity of 800MW, as well as most smaller generation assets. State-owned Mepso operates the electricity transmission system and EVN, an Austrian utility, has enjoyed a monopoly on electricity distribution for over a decade."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Macedonia fully electrified its population in 2016. The modernization of the domestic power fleet is under way, with 2015 seeing ELEM launch the third phase of a program looking into restoring one of the country’s main thermal power plants. The government is also exploring converting the mothballed heavy oil-fired TEC Negotino power plant to natural gas. Demand is, however, decreasing – peak usage has dropped by approximately 12% since 2010. This trend has been matched by a reduction in domestic electricity production by a quarter over the last decade. Meanwhile imports, mostly in the form of Russian gas funneled in through Bulgaria, have risen to 34% of consumption."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"A key obstacle in Macedonia is the large number of institutions involved in handling procedures and licensing, in addition to the lack of coordination among the bodies involved. There is no one-stop shop overseeing all aspects of project development, but recent years have seen progress being made in streamlining application processes. Having been defined by legislation, the timetable for handling applications is clear – the average time for getting decision on applications is between one and two months. Offtaker risk is minimal, and curtailment is a non-issue given the low levels of variable renewables capacity connected to the grid."}]}
