energy policy","value":"Iraq aims to generate 10% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020 under the country�s Integrated National Energy Strategy (INES). The Ministry of Energy is unlikely to achieve this target having already fallen behind on its plan: it has identified 13 potential locations for developing PV projects in Baghdad, Anbar and four other provinces as part of its investment strategy. The ministry offered a 15-year fixed feed-in tariff of $35/MWh and has outlined 2.7GW of potential PV projects. However, unclear investment and operation laws in the electricity sector and a lack of support from international financial institutions are deterring investment in renewables."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Hydro and solar have been the focus of renewables investment in Iraq to date. Despite 2.5GW of installed hydro capacity, just over half is available to generate due to damages and aging infrastructure. In 2019, the Ministry of Energy has issued tenders for seven projects with a total capacity of 755MW. Financing renewables projects in Iraq is difficult, and private investors are forced to rely on local banks that lack experience in financing larger projects. With 50% of electricity lost before billing and only 50% of bills collected, there is a high perception of risk surrounding investments in the country�s energy sector."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The government subsidizes electricity and fuel prices, giving Iraqis some of the cheapest prices in the world. The supply of electricity is unreliable and available for less than 15 hours a day. This has forced consumers to turn to private, predominantly diesel, generators for supply. Cheap electricity has led to very high consumption, with each household consuming twice as much on average as in neighbouring Jordan. As a result, electricity subsidies cost the Iraqi government 3.4% of GDP each year while fuel subsidies cost it 3.6%. The government has introduced a progressive tariff increase to reduce the subsidy and encourage efficient consumption of electricity."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The energy ministry acts as policy maker, power producer, service provider, operator and regulator in Iraq. Gas turbines account for over half of the generation capacity, with steam comprising almost a third. Hydro has traditionally played a role but damage from recent wars has limited generation capacity. Electricity and gas imports from Iran help meet demand, especially during the summer peak. U.S. sanctions of Iran also impact the gas imports from Iran, but Iraq has managed to get waivers from the U.S. The extension of these waivers remains a key uncertainty for Iraq�s power sector. The ministry aims to have independent power producers build 9GW of power capacity by 2025 in an attempt to meet domestic demand and reduce reliance on imports. By unbundling the market and introducing the private sector into the distribution and generation segments, the ministry hopes to improve its financial position."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"International industrials such as General Electric, Siemens and ABB are working with the Iraqi government to repair and upgrade power plants in an attempt to sustain current plant production and rehabilitate capacity damaged during years of conflict. The government also aims to strengthen the grid and reconnect areas in the north and west with the rest of the country. Despite these attempts, Iraq�s demand exceeds peak load by almost 50% in hot periods, when air-conditioning units consume the most power. With demand growing in excess of 7% each year, further capacity will be necessary to avoid continued shortages."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Political risk and the absence of incentives deter investment in the renewables sector. The Ministry of Energy has tried to incentivize foreign developers to enter the renewables market with tax incentives. Projects in areas defined by the National Investment Council (NIC) are exempt from taxes and fees for 10 years from the date of completion. When the developer adds capacity to the plant, the period restarts for an additional 10 years. The NIC can also extend the period of exemption up to 15 years if the Iraqi investor share of the project exceeds 50%. Equipment imported for the construction of the project is exempt from customs duties, as are raw materials imported for the commercial operation of the plant. Following failed tender processes in 2011, the ministry in 2014 entered into PPAs with three Iraqi IPPs. Difficulties transferring land to the projects, applying the grid code and complying with environmental laws have delayed the process."}]}
