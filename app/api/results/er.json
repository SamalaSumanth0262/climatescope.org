energy policy","value":"Eritrea aims for renewables to account for 70% of electricity generation by 2030, as part of its NDC, but does not yet have any enabling framework to bring it toward this goal. It also plans to improve power sector infrastructure to reduce transmission and distribution losses by at least 50% by the same year. One small-scale minigrid was commissioned in 2018 to power two towns, with international aid from the UNDP. A hybrid solar-diesel system is also operational as of 2018, but provides captive generation for a mining operation. There are no incentives for renewables developers, and very little transparency on existing regulations."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Eritrea has so far attracted some international aid for clean energy projects, but investment is very limited. There is no framework for public-private partnerships, and no incentives to attract international interest. Rapprochement with Ethiopia, agreed in summer 2018, could lead to a gradual opening of the economy to international involvement, but so far interest has been limited to the mining sector. This does offer opportunities for clean energy, as PV panels installed alongside diesel generators offer cost savings. However, this solution has only been implemented in one case so far."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices are regulated in Eritrea, but nearly all the on-grid capacity is diesel generation. Diesel costs in Eritrea are among the most expensive in Africa, but the full brunt of the costs are not passed along to the consumer. Wind and solar resources are good, but financing costs are likely high."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Urban electrification levels are fairly high, but fully reliant on diesel generation. In rural areas, access to electricity is much more variable. Eritrea has no interconnection with its neighbors, though now that relations are improving with Ethiopia there is talk of potential links. The power market itself is vertically integrated with no private participation nor any known plans for reform."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The absence of a reliable electricity supply in many areas of the country offers opportunities, especially for minigrid developers, but Eritrea is an extremely closed country and doing business is difficult. Power consumption per capita is among the lowest in Africa, which also offers opportunities, if capacity and infrastructure are improved."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The lack of frameworks for private investment in Eritrea is a major barrier to renewables development. Importing not only renewables components but equipment in general is cumbersome, and there is very little transparency in general around the existing regulatory framework. Political risk is significant in the single-party country, where media freedom is severely restricted. Eritrea and Ethiopia reached a rapprochement, which could signal a move toward more open government, but the country has a long way to go before it might tempt investors."}]}
