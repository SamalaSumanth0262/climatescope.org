energy policy","value":"Russia aims to increase the share of renewable energy in power generation from under 1% currently to 2.5% by 2024. In 2013, the country launched an annual renewables auction program to support solar, wind and small hydro. The target was originally set in 2009, at a more ambitious 4.5% by 2020, but this was revised down in 2013. Though the policy is due to expire in five years, it is widely expected that support for renewables will continue beyond 2024. The auctions are accessible to all, but a local partner is required for international firms. So far, they�ve attracted domestic and international players. However, much of the capacity awarded so far has not actually been built yet."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Russia�s renewables capacity accounts for less than 1% of total capacity, even though auctions have been running since 2013, as many of the awarded projects are yet to be built. However, as foreign companies, including Fortum, Enel and Vestas become increasingly active in Russia�s renewables auctions, this could drive more projects to complete. More renewable capacity came into operation in 2017 than the two previous years combined, according to the Ministry of Energy, showing the pace is stepping up. Fortum owns Russia�s first wholesale wind farm, commissioned in January 2018, and was the biggest winner in Russia�s 2018 auctions, securing both solar and wind capacity. Financing is a barrier to business in Russia due to international sanctions."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Russia benefits from some of the lowest electricity prices for residential, commercial and industrial customers compared to its neighbors, though prices vary significantly by region. This is a result of the low cost of energy resources, as natural gas makes up the majority of power generation and Russia has an abundance of cheap natural gas. That said, electricity prices are increasing at an annual rate of roughly 5%. Rates are also likely to continue to rise on the back of planned modernization works on Russia�s ageing power fleet."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"At the end of 2018, Russia had an installed capacity of 242GW. Though generation, system operation, transmission and distribution are managed by separate entities, much of them are state owned.  Fossil fuels account for more than 60% of Russia�s power generation. Due to Russia�s wealth of oil and gas resources, renewables are unlikely to meaningfully displace fossil fuels in the near future, in particular, natural gas generation. However, renewables are being used to improve domestic power supply to remote regions that are not connected to the grid. These regions traditionally relied on power generation from oil. So, while natural gas is likely to remain the dominant generation technology, generation from oil has fallen by more than two thirds since 2000."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Russia�s climate and expansive land means it has significant resource potential for wind and solar, but meaningful development has thus far been held back by a number of barriers including volatile exchange rates, high local content requirements and international sanctions. Russia has a good grid and road network to support industry, and it has a 100% electrification rate. Electricity demand in Russia has remained fairly flat and is expected to continue to do so, as a result of sluggish economic growth.  Though electricity generation has increased by roughly 25% since 2000, it has only recently reached pre-1990 levels, prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the economic shock that ensued"},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"High local content requirements for wind and solar have proven challenging to meet, particularly for wind projects. Early auctions for wind projects were very quiet, as there was little availability of Russian-made equipment. Over time, however, these requirements have succeeded in advancing the local industry by requiring the partnership of foreign developers with local firms. The requirements have gradually risen over time, to currently 65% and 70% for wind and solar, respectively, and are expected to increase further after 2020. Currency fluctuations and weak growth in electricity-demand forecasts also act as a barrier to potential investment."}]}
