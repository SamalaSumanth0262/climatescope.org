Rajasthan ranked third among the 10 Indian states surveyed for Climatescope 2014. It scored 1.15 and performed best in Parameter II, Clean Energy Investment because of significant growth in investments in last few years.

Services comprise roughly half of the $85bn economy of the desert state, with agriculture slightly less than one-third. Rajasthan received $679m in clean energy investments in 2013 out of a total of $7.8bn from 2006–13. Wind is the flagship sector, attracting 60% of investment during 2006–13, and now accounting for 77% of the state’s 3.5GW clean energy capacity.

In 2013, Rajasthan generated an estimated 51TWh, although not all of it was consumed within the state. Coal-fired plants were responsible for 68% of this total, while renewables comprised only 7% (but represented 30% of installed capacity). The state’s distribution utilities are in poor financial and operational health, with ‘C+’ ratings from the Ministry of Power.

Rajasthan has very good clean energy resources. As India’s sunniest and desert region, it is a logical choice for large solar projects. The state is the location of choice for many developers contracted under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission. By 2015, Rajasthan will likely have the largest solar capacity of any Indian state, surpassing current leader Gujurat.

At a state level, however, Rajasthan does little to attract solar development.

In 2013, Rajasthan had hoped to hold the country’s first ever wind auctions, but after stiff opposition from developers, it withdrew the plan. Today, the state has generous feed-in tariffs to compensate for low capacity factors, and it continues to attract new wind investment.
