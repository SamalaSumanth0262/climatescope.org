Guangdong scored 1.22, taking sixth place among the 15 Chinese provinces assessed on Climatescope 2014. It performed best in Low-Carbon Business and Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, scoring high marks for its value chains and financial institutions active in clean energy.

Guangdong is a southern coastal province and site of the first private enterprise hub after the ‘opening up’ of China in the late 1970s.

In 2013, its GDP was $1,027bn, roughly the same as Spain’s.

The province relies heavily on imported coal and natural gas for electricity generation. In 2013, it sourced 69.2% of the total 365TWh from coal-fired power plants; with most of the remainder coming from natural gas (the province has a quarter of China’s natural gas plants).

Renewable energy is a small part of the mix, generating just 7.6% of the total in 2013. Most of this (78.5%) was produced by small hydropower. Guangdong has 9.5GW of

installed renewable energy capacity, representing 12.1% of the province aggregate.

In 2013, Guangdong received $722.4m in clean energy investment, out of a cumulative $6bn since 2006. The wind sector received the largest amount, followed by biomass and waste-to-energy.

Guangdong is one of seven provinces piloting an emissions trading program. Launched in December 2013, the scheme aims to cut carbon intensity and prepare it for a national trading system that is scheduled to begin in 2016.

The province also has the potential to import renewable energy from the north and west. In 2013, a second ultra-high voltage transmission line from Yunnan to Guangdong was commissioned, potentially increasing the amount of renewable power it imports and decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.
