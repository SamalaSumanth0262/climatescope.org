Sichuan ranked 10th among the 15 Chinese provinces analyzed by Climatescope 2014. It scored 1.11, performing best on Greenhouse Gas Management Parameter IV on account of its carbon offset programs and widespread corporate awareness of its energy efficiency initiatives and emissionreduction policies.

Located in southwest China, Sichuan is a large and diverse province with several major rivers and mountain ranges. It is an important electronics and automobile manufacturing centre and the provincial government is making efforts to host a free trade zone, which would further boost manufacturing. In 2013, its GDP was $433.7bn.

As part of a national policy to help develop China’ s central and western regions, Sichuan has lower business tax rates than other parts of the country, including those that apply to energy infrastructure.

Sichuan attracted $1.0bn in clean energy investment in 2013, a substantial portion of the total $4.4bn invested between 2006 and 2013. Total renewable energy capacity stood at 8.5GW in 2013, of which 8.1GW was small hydro (however, this sub-sector only accounted for around 65% of total investment).

In 2013, Sichuan sourced 57.2% of its total 212.9TWh electricity needs from large hydropower. Renewable energy forms a significant part of the province’s energy mix and corresponded to 15.8% of generation in 2013 and 15.5% of installed capacity.

In 2013, the province added new wind and solar capacity, including one relatively large 30MW PV installation; however, small hydropower is expected to remain the dominant clean energy source.
