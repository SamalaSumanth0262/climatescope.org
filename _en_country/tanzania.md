Tanzania took 21st place in Climatescope 2014, with a score of 1.23. While its highest ranking was 12th on Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, it also has the most attractive policy framework for small grid-connected and other distributed renewable energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa.

The East African country has yet to see significant levels of clean energy investment: it finished 41st on Clean Energy Investment Parameter II, the countryâ€™s lowest position on any parameter. It attracted just $125m of financing between 2006 and 2013, mainly in the biomass and small hydro sectors.

Large hydro makes up over one-third of the 1.5GW of total capacity, although low reservoir levels have reduced availability to about 55%, forcing load shedding and emergency diesel generation. A key objective of the government is to replace this capacity with natural gas and coal-fired power plants and renewable energy. It has set a target of 14% clean energy in the power mix in 2015, including small hydro.

A new renewable energy policy, feed-in tariff, geothermal regulatory framework and biofuel policy were due to be published by the government in 2014.
