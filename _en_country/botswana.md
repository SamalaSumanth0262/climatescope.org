Botswana placed 48th among Climatescope nations with an overall score of 0.62. It performed best on Low-Carbon Business Parameter III, especially related to the presence of distributed clean energy service providers.

The countryâ€™s outdated power sector relies on coal for 60% of its generation, while approximately one-third of the population lacks access to electricity of any kind. Botswana depends on power imports from South Africa as its own generating capacity has regularly proven unreliable over the last eight years.
Nonetheless, the country has seen some activity in the off-grid solar sector.

The government is currently crafting a national energy policy, which outlines new strategies and highlights the need for renewables to be integrated into the power sector. However, the current policy framework provides no specific incentives for clean energy and the impetus for implementing the new policy in the near future is unclear.
