To assign each country an overall score, the Global Climatescope examines four overarching and interrelated parameters described below. These parameters are supported by a series of 50 indicators based on data captured by Bloomberg New Energy Finance through first-hand research, consultation of publicly available sources and discussions with experts. Together, these indicators and their corresponding parameters form a holistic picture of a particular country's climate for climate-related investment.

## I. Enabling Framework 
The existing policies, power market structures and levels of clean energy capacity online in a given country, as well as other market-size related factors. 

## II. Clean Energy Investment & Climate Financing
Funds deployed in support of clean energy, plus the availability and cost of local capital such as microfinance. 

## III. Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains 
The availability of local manufacturing and supply chains for clean energy goods, services and financing.

## IV. Greenhouse Gas Management Activities
The extent of actions taken and projects developed under the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism.
